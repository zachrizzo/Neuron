      "Transcription(text=\"to listen to mom. When mom was doing a photo shoot, Cole, like her class, she was going to a field, so she got some pink flags. And I was holding the flags, and Cole's complaining, why should I not, why should I, why did sissy get to hold the flags? And I'm like, Cole, just deal with it, and mom's like, just give him one, and like, fine. So, and then he was messing with it, and then he almost sticked me in the eye with it. That's why, that's why he got it taken away, and it got even worse. That's when he said it at lunch. And, and I was in tears in the car. And mom's like, what's wrong? And I told her, and she's like, well, you're not, you're letting him get to, you're letting him get to you. And I'm like, I'm serious, I'm not, in tears. I said, I'm serious, I'm not. And she always takes Cole's side. Oh, how does that make you feel when she takes Cole's side? Really, really bad. Like, really, really mad. Yeah, so mad, like more angry. And what, what color would you connect to being angry? Anxiety and red. Okay, so the orange for the anxiety, and then red for, for anger. Okay. And blue for sadness. I don't know what color that makes, but with all three colors combined, I don't know what that makes. Yeah. Okay. And what about for, do you ever have happy emotions? Not really. Not really. So your main emotions are anger, and having anxiety and sadness. Okay. How does that feel having just those, mostly just those three emotions? Like I work too hard that I just noticed that it's not even worth it anymore. To work hard, it's not worth working hard. Yeah, it's not really worth it. So, I mean, I don't want to get rid of those emotions, they want to have them, but not like all the time, not on a daily basis, you know. But it does happen every single day. Yeah, I can see that it's got to be frustrating. Can you draw me a picture of what these emotions would look like if you had them on paper, if you could draw it? How much of one would be there? How much each emotion would be there? And if there's any other emotions? Well, like, what's the ideas? Because you said I have some pretty good ideas, like to draw, like, for emotions. If you can show me, what are the ideas? Like what they already have? Let's see, there's a couple of them. Let me share my screen. Okay, let's see. Okay, so one of them, can you see this? Yeah. So somebody's got this one. And then somebody drew this for one of them. So there's no, there's no right or wrong. It's, it's truly just going to be like how you feel. You can draw anything. This one is like an extreme emotions. That's so anything you want. Like, a few days ago, I draw myself with a mirror. But and then when Cole was taking I mean, mom was taking Cole to school, we had I had to go with her. So I wouldn't be in the house alone. And then when I got back, I was in tears again, because I'll have a jumped up and he spilled all over the floor. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the I'll have a jumped up. And he spilled milk like I had a cup of milk right next to my piece of paper. So we got it dried. It was fine. It's just I couldn't really erase or anything. Let me see. Oh, that's incredible. Wow. So that was a mirror of how you felt? Yeah, I was just And so how did? How did it feel after you drew that? I felt kind of weird. Do you feel any better? Did you feel any worse? I felt a little worse. I don't know why. I thought that would help. So how do you feel about Christmas coming up? What's your emotions about Christmas? Really exciting. Okay. And what is the light blue? It's like a light blue. A light blue. Okay. So do you want to draw how you're going to feel about how your emotions about how you feel about Christmas coming? You could draw anything. You could draw some Christmas trees, a Christmas present and use well, Christmas tree would be green, but anything you want that has the colors that you with your emotions. Um, can I go get the paper and paint? Yes, of course. Because I didn't get anything ready. That's okay. Okay. Oh, you found it? Okay. Other thing that we can show and express our emotions is by certain kinds of lines that you're going to be coloring with. So we've got straight lines, jagged lines, zigzag lines, and also like the direction of the line that you're going to draw. So you could draw something like an emotion going up an emotion going down to show like how much like if you're going to if you're going to draw something about feeling happy, then you can draw like a line going up if that's how you feel happy or if you feel happy with the line coming down. Or if you feel sad, like which direction is it a zigzag line and and adding in the color. Does that make sense? That kind of does it. You know, it's hard because as you know, because you're such a good artist, like, there's not really many rules about drawing. You know what you're feeling or what you're thinking? Yeah, you just do it. You just don't think of doing it, you just do it. Yeah. So sorry, I have the hiccups. You're nervous a little bit? What are you nervous about? I'm trying to be good for happy. Oh, well, we don't have to do happy. Do you want to do another a sad one? I don't know. Or an angry one? We can do any way that you're feeling. Um, I have an idea. Okay. So I get water and then I get like a big brush. Huh? And then to get some water. And then I get like Christmas colors, maybe. Going to start out with the green. I love this idea. This is great. And then get more green, like to make it like all mushy and like make sure you really got it like soaked in paintbrush. And then here's the twist. Put it back in your cup. And then you just throw it around. And if you need more, then you can grab more. I love that. What a great idea. And then always need more glitter because I got glitter, a lot of color. And then we, um, we make sure all the watercolor paints out of it, then we put it back in all of our brushes. And then you dip your hand in there kind of, kind of like splash it on the paper, splash, splash, you know. I mean, like more color here. I love that. Oh my gosh, what a great idea. You're so artistic. Splash, splash, splash, yes. Splash. For some reason, the color's not showing up. Hmm. I thought it would. That's a lot of color. There. There, I got a lot of color. Oh, nice. And if you really want to do like a dark color, then get a color red. And what emotion does red mean to you again? Is that anger? Yeah, yes. What emotion do you feel like you feel the most throughout your day? Orange. So the anxiety? Yes. There, I got like, like a gray. That's what I wanted. And we splash it some more on our paper. I love that you're so artistic. And then we kind of let that dry. But like, make sure you get it like, like all over the place, like no missing spots on the paper. Well, we're gonna leave that to dry. Okay. Because the most important thing is letting it dry. Because if you don't let it dry, then basically, well, it's not gonna work. Okay, that makes sense. Let me get let me get a washcloth. Sorry, it kind of got all over the tablet. So I'm only let that dry. Like, if you want to make it fast, you can use a blow dryer, but I want to do that. Yeah, that's, I can't wait to see it once it dries. So what did you tell me about what you what you made? Like the colors? Or what? How does it relate to your feelings? Because there's a bunch of splashes in my mind of feelings. And, you know, like, I kind of wanted a red in my cup. But I got the gray because I got green first. Mm hmm. But it's like doing a line with a pencil. And you know, like when you erase, it doesn't erase all the way. Right? Right. So you just erase and you erase and you erase nonstop. What color so you got mostly gray or so you got the same color when you're erasing? Okay, yeah. But you wanted more of an orange to show more anger? Yeah. Okay. Do you feel like anything helps the anxiety or the anger that you feel during the days? No, not really. It's my slime. Okay, yeah. Kind of a special. What kind of slime did you get? Oh, put that on me, Alexa. My Alexa's like, don't put you there. Mine does that too. And, like, what were you gonna say? What kind of slime did you get? Do you get do you have? I have a lot of slimes. Lots of different kinds. Did you go to the slime store? They have a slime store that just sells just slime. Oh, that's cool. But no, I just went to Walmart. We got this like big bunk of junk basket full of slimes. Oh, very cool. I wish I could go there. It would be the love of my life. Slime is boogers. And I'm like, no, it's not. Yeah, I actually like to play with it, too. It's kind of fun. So, so you like so playing with slime is a little bit, a little bit helpful. So how often throughout the day do you feel like you're getting this angry and feeling and this anxiety feeling? I'm like, a lot. 100%. Okay. Sometimes 99, but only sometimes. So when you first wake up in the morning, do you feel it? Or does it take a little bit of time to start coming on? It takes a little bit of time to start coming on. Okay. Does anything make it worse? A lot. Like what specific? Cole. Your brother? Yeah. And what? And what does he do? What are the things that he does that's making it that makes it worse? Like mom and dad told me to suck it up. Like even dad, like I told them, I hate the words. I hate the sentence suck it up. But and I told them that the dad forgot because he said that yesterday. So I couldn't wait. So I just had dabbed it like with my washcloth. So and if you like, do you have this type of pen? I think it's called a pen. Yeah. Let me go get it. Okay. Okay. I got it. Okay, good. Sorry, I had to jump. It was in my Posca marker thing. Okay. So it's like a small Sharpie. And then around the spiders, if you still can't see them, can you kind of like outline them with a black pencil like this until you're all done with them. But if it's still too wet, just make sure you dab it a little more. Okay. You'd be an amazing art teacher too. Okay. It's not really working because I don't know why. Is it because it's wet too wet? No, I tried it like really good. It's just not doing its thing. Okay. So you were saying that your dad basically says, tells you to suck it up, but your brother gets away with more? Yes, he gets more attention. He gets everything that he wants. Hmm. So how does that make you feel when that happens? Like I'm a ghost, like nobody's, like everybody's ignoring me and it just feels sad. Yeah, I can understand that. That would really feel sad. Is there any times that you don't feel like a ghost? No. So it's always? Yeah. I can see how that would really hurt you, make you feel, feel upset. Do you feel like when you are angry or show more of your anger emotions, does that get you more attention or less attention? Less. That's why I don't want to tell anybody my emotions. So you feel it's better to try to hold them in? Yeah. Does that seem to caught when you're holding in your feelings? Does that give you more anxiety, more of the orange color? Yes. Okay. Okay. I wonder if there's a way that we can talk to people about how we're feeling and get a better result from them. So like, I wonder if we can figure out. They'll always say the same thing because I know my mom, my dad, everybody else at school, they always say the same thing. Even the teachers at school, they always say the same thing. What did they say? Sometimes I don't even remember because it's just stuck on my head too much that my memory wants it out of my head. Yeah. And it's hard to, we don't like to remember things that make us unhappy too. So that makes sense. I wonder if maybe this week you can try to pay attention to what people are saying when you try to talk about your feelings to them. And then do you ever, do you know how to journal? Do you write things down ever? Only sometimes I do. Do you like to do it or no? Only sometimes. Okay. I wonder if we can try to, if you can try to remember this week and pay attention to what people say that make you, make you not want to share your emotions. And then, and then we can talk about it next week. Do you think that at least you don't have to say anything to them? Just take note of what they say that makes you upset, that hurts your feelings, that makes you not want to share your feelings. That way we can pay attention. Does that sound good? Yeah. It's just sometimes I don't want to say it. I just remembered it right now, but it's the same word that my dad says a lot. And my mom says a lot and everybody else says a lot. Which one is it? The suck it up buttercup one. Okay. And everybody keeps just telling you to suck it up instead of. Yeah. I can totally understand how upsetting and why you would just not share your feelings. That makes sense. That probably makes you really upset. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if we can think of another different way to say it. So like when, when your brother is, when your mom or dad seems like they're giving him more attention, how do you tell them that? Like act like I'm your mom or your dad and your brother just did the same thing that you did, but you got in trouble and your brother didn't get in trouble. I would get so mad that I would probably scream a bad word, but I never did that. But I always want to. Right. Right. So you get so upset and you would scream at mom and dad, though you would scream and yell. Is that what you would do? Yeah. Okay. And I understand. I mean, I, I would too at times, especially if I felt like I was being mistreated. But I wonder if, have you tried to sit down and say like mom or dad, when, when brother is, does the same thing I do and he doesn't get in trouble, it hurts my feelings when I get in trouble for the same thing. Instead of screaming and yelling, I wonder if we could just try and see if how they react. And I never tried screaming and yelling. I only do that in my head. Oh, do you? So you hold it in? Yeah. That might be what's causing some of your anxiety is holding that in. We don't want to scream and yell because that might not, that's probably not going to get us the result that we want, but we want to be able to talk about our feelings in an appropriate way. So we want to try to learn that. Yeah. But I also want to make my voice clear. That's why I yell because people, when I talk in my normal voice, they, they act like I'm not there. Hmm. Like you even yelled once. Well, it wasn't a bad word, but I said, is anyone trying at least to listen to me? Like really loud. And nobody's, everybody's like, no, we're just ignoring you. That makes sense. I mean, I understand why you scream. I mean, that's, I would do the same thing if I felt like if nobody was listening for sure. If you felt invisible, I can understand that.  Sometimes when we scream, people shut down though, and they, they still don't hear us. So we have to think of a different way to get them to hear us. Yeah. But I tried every single way. Yeah. I can see that's frustrating for you for sure. What's your drawing you got so far? Good. Is it working? Yeah. So what are you going to be asking for Christmas for? Well, I kind of get shy when I try to say it. Do you want me to tell you what I'm asking for Christmas first? Sure. Okay. So I made my Christmas list to my kids and I said, I want a trip to Fiji. I want a trip to New Zealand. I want a trip. They're all trips, by the way. Oh. A trip to Bali and a trip to Africa. Why would you want to go to Africa? People kidnap you in Africa. Not all, not all parts. No, I, there are certain parts that are like safari. I would love to see like the elephants and I'd love to go on a safari. Okay, what do you want now? Can you see me? Yep. Can you see that? Yes, a beautiful kitty cat. What's her name or his name? Oliver and that's what I wrote for Christmas. You want another kitty cat? That's my pre-owned. I told mom and she's like, I would like 10 kitty cats. But dad said, maybe only if you'd be good. Like, and I said, it will sleep with me. I'll make it, I'll check its litter box. I'll cuddle with it. I always wanted my very own pet because I always sleep alone in my room with my stuffies. I'm kind of lonely. Well, I don't really want dogs because dogs snore. And mom says, I know dogs snore, but cats snore too. And like, I never heard all the bears snore then. And she's like, oh, whatever. So your dad says, if you're good, when he says, if you're good, what does he mean? What does he want you to do? Like a big huge, maybe. And like, be really good for him and happy. I wrote a letter to Santa and I used a lot of reallys. Lots of the word, really? You really, really, really, really, really, really want a cat like that? No, like five paragraphs of really. Oh, my gosh. I said, I really, really, really like four paragraphs later, really, really want a cat or a kitten, like whichever you want. I'll be good for happy and you. That was for Santa Claus and I drew him a picture. And then I also said, that's the whole thing I want in the whole entire world. And then I draw me on the picture, opening a box with little dots and then big dots. That means like so the kitty can breathe and stuff. Oh, well, did you did you try to tell your dad the reasons why you're not happy? Yeah, because have you heard of the therapy dog? I told him I want a therapy cat. Oh, so you think the cat's going to help you help take away the anger and the anxiety? Yeah. Sorry, it's just I. I was talking with mom one night and I left my tissue box in there. So I got the tissue box for out here and it's still in my room right now. So I just grabbed. Oh, thank you. Have allergies. Yeah, really bad. Yeah, me too, especially right now. I don't sneeze at all with the cat. No, no, it's not from the cat. Like no dog, no dog, no dog. So if I'm sure a cat would probably help a lot. But if you're angry because you feel like you're you're nobody notices you or hears you. We that I don't know if the cat's going to help people hear you. So we have to try to figure out a way that we can have. It helps me. Well, it helps me get attention. Yes. Because everybody says, who's that cat? And I'm like, my like, oh, you're so cool, because I'm already turning nine. And I'm going to keep the cat for the rest of my life. And like, when they come over, when I turn 10, they're going to be like, oh, that's so cute. Oh, I'm like, I really want to calico. That's a girl. But mom says calicos are all girls. And all girls are really sassy. Boys are more cuddly. And like, I didn't know that. Yeah. But this Oliver is really sassy. Oh, he's still a boy. He's still a boy. Right. So you want a girl cat? Yeah. But I was thinking to do it. I was thinking to do a boy cat, but it's fine. I need girls have more problems. Oh, do they? Yeah. It goes with dogs, too. Like, look. Oh, I love that. Tell me what it means. It means. It's like I'm. It means so I was going to get my pinkish. Yeah.  I was going to take orange. Okay. And then paint one of the dots orange. Okay. I want to stay in the line. So but mom got me this app on her tablet, which I'm talking to you on right now. I don't know what it's called, but it's like where I draw. And it's like so cool. Oh, that is really cool. And then I paint another one orange. And then a few more orange. Okay. So when you when you feel this anxiety, where in your body are you feeling it? I feel it in here. Yeah, I did here. Your chest and your belly. Okay. Like sometimes my belly, my stomach gets a little angry. Sometimes when I'm sad or mad. How long does it usually last the feeling? For a long, long time. Okay, does it? How does it go away? What makes it go away? When mom and dad like pay attention to me, they be nice to me. They do things for me. Okay. It's just all I want is respect and attention. That's pretty much all I want. Like when I tell Cole not to mess with me, he doesn't listen. Yeah, that sounds like it can be really frustrating. So it's like I kind of like to sometimes go out of the lines because it kind of looks cool. Mm hmm. And I'm about to be done with orange and then I'm gonna go to red next. Okay. When you are when you're in the red, when you're feeling angry, does the anger come on really quickly? Yes, I get I, I get anger issues really easy. Okay. Like, when people like when people walk in slow in front of me, I kind of just walk in front of them like really fast when I'm kind of in a rush. And oh, people walking into me, it's school. Oh, it's gone way too far already. And you on purpose or they bump where they bump? Yeah, they bump into me on purpose. They don't even say sorry. They just run away laughing. Oh, yeah, that would make me pretty upset too. So when you're with anyone pretty much at school, what did you say? I said, that's why I don't like to play with anyone at school pretty much because just sad, you know? Because I'm gonna leave some white because it's kind of when I like blinked out white means like, what was I doing? Or like, where was I going? You know? So now a little more red. Get that color in. That one, that one, and then blue. Blue now. And the blue is when you're sad? Yes. Okay. But did you know there's an Inside Out 2 in 2024? No, I didn't know that. I'm so excited because the new emotion is coming in. And it is anxiety. When new emotions come in, it's called puberty, I think. And I already passed that. When you should have puberty, like at 12 or 13 or something. Mm hmm. So you feel like you already passed that? Yeah, way past that. Like when I lost my first tooth. Like when I lost my first tooth, I was three years old, and my brother's five years old, and he barely lost any teeth yet. Oh, wow. You did. I'm already moving fast. Let's get this done over with quick snap. Right? Well, you are very mature. That's for sure. Yeah. That's probably why it seems like the kids in your school are quite immature. That would be that would be annoying for sure to be around people that were younger and bumped into you and did all that kind of stuff. So do you like People that were older than me that bumped into me like on purpose, I would get kind of scared because they're taller than me, they're bigger than me, especially boys bump into me like they're bigger than me, I get really scared and I don't say anything. I'm like really nervous. Oh, no. Like what if they'll punch me in the face? I mean, they never do. But right, right. It's just a what if, you know? So are you do you feel like you like being homeschooled better now? Yeah, but my mom's sending me to school next week. I'm like, why you? Okay. Like, why? How do you feel about that? Bad. Yeah. Are you what are you worried about? People are like gonna surround me because I don't really like it when I have too much attention. Because like people surround me ask me questions, they say weird stuff. They do a lot of things. A lot of weird things. Yeah. You can't believe what I'm doing right now. Can't wait to see it. Well, like with oil paints, to me, I'm not really a big fan. That's why I'm kind of not good. It's just oil paints. They dry really fast. So I don't blend that well. You know? Yeah, if the coloring, drawing watercolor, you know? Now I'm gonna do golden. I'm just gonna make it have a little red and make it like kind of orangey goldish, you know? Mm hmm. Like when I talk a lot, that means I'm like happy and fine. But that's like 2% of the time. So. Okay. How do you feel right now at this moment? Um, I'm really excited and happy this year. You're really excited and happy? Yeah, that happy this year. That happy? Oh, that the elfies there came to your house? Yeah. Oh, very nice. You call him happy? Yeah, his name is happy. When we first met him, we're like, whoa. On a note, his name is happy. Nice to meet you. One time, like last year, he said, I brought you snowmen from the North Pole, but it melted like with some carrots and like little rocks inside, you know, and in a little hat. How exciting. So I did some, um. Hold on. Where's the other? I did some Christmas trees and ornaments. Oh my gosh, I love that. Hold on, let me make my screen bigger so I can see better. Okay, now show me again. Let me see. Let me just get the excess off the watercolor brushes because they might drip and they don't ruin my painting because that happens to me a lot. Okay. Hold on. I forgot something. Oh my gosh, I love it. So I do see more of the orange for the anxiety, some blue, some red, there's a green even. What's the green mean? The green means just best, just like for the Christmas trees, and the white means like, what was I doing? I have a lot of whites. Oh, well, like my mom says, like, like when I was talking to another therapist, I think on Thursday. Um. Hold on. I was, um, kind of, I don't know what to say. It's like my mom said, maybe I had ADHD. And I'm like, what does that mean? And she's like, well, it's like, you flinch around and move, you don't sit down. And I'm like, yeah, I don't really, unless I have my tablet. And I don't, I like kind of move around, walk around, you know, nonstop. And then I'm like, still crazy at night. I'm like, oh, that's weird. But I think I like that. It's cute. Yeah, I love it. I love it. I think it looks like abstract, you know, because I kind of outside the lines and I, and I like it kind of because I always go with the lines. It does look very abstract. I love that. And I love that you even know that word. You're so smart. Well, how do I know this word? It's longer than Mississippi. What word? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Wow, that is a long word. It took me three years to say it. Like my dad says, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. You're cute. And congratulations on losing your tooth. And I'm glad Elphie is with you. And I will see you next week. You have anything else you want to talk about before we go? No, not really. All right. Your, your picture was amazing. Thank you so much for sharing that with me. Okay. All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye. Bye.\")\n"

She described feeling intense anger represented by the color red and anxiety represented by orange, with very little happiness. The client also discussed feeling sad and lonely at times.

The therapist suggested journaling and exploring alternative ways to communicate her feelings. The client's artwork depicted her emotional spectrum through colors and symbols and reflected her struggle with feeling unheard and invisible.

When mom was doing a photo shoot, Cole, like her class, she was going to a field, so she got some pink flags. And I was holding the flags, and Cole's complaining, why should I not, why should I, why did sissy get to hold the flags? And I'm like, Cole, just deal with it, and mom's like, just give him one, and like, fine. So, and then he was messing with it, and then he almost sticked me in the eye with it. That's why, that's why he got it taken away, and it got even worse. That's when he said it at lunch. And, and I was in tears in the car. And mom's like, what's wrong? And I told her, and she's like, well, you're not, you're letting him get to, you're letting him get to you. And I'm like, I'm serious, I'm not, in tears. I said, I'm serious, I'm not. And she always takes Cole's side. Oh, how does that make you feel when she takes Cole's side? Really, really bad. Like, really, really mad. Yeah, so mad, like more angry. And what, what color would you connect to being angry? Anxiety and red. Okay, so the orange for the anxiety, and then red for, for anger. Okay. And blue for sadness. I don't know what color that makes, but with all three colors combined, I don't know what that makes. Yeah. Okay. And what about for, do you ever have happy emotions? Not really. Not really. So your main emotions are anger, and having anxiety and sadness. Okay. How does that feel having just those, mostly just those three emotions? Like I work too hard that I just noticed that it's not even worth it anymore. To work hard, it's not worth working hard. Yeah, it's not really worth it. So, I mean, I don't want to get rid of those emotions, they want to have them, but not like all the time, not on a daily basis, you know. But it does happen every single day. Yeah, I can see that it's got to be frustrating. Can you draw me a picture of what these emotions would look like if you had them on paper, if you could draw it? How much of one would be there? How much each emotion would be there? And if there's any other emotions? Well, like, what's the ideas? Because you said I have some pretty good ideas, like to draw, like, for emotions. If you can show me, what are the ideas? Like what they already have? Let's see, there's a couple of them. Let me share my screen. Okay, let's see. Okay, so one of them, can you see this? Yeah. So somebody's got this one. And then somebody drew this for one of them. So there's no, there's no right or wrong. It's, it's truly just going to be like how you feel. You can draw anything. This one is like an extreme emotions. That's so anything you want. Like, a few days ago, I draw myself with a mirror. But and then when Cole was taking I mean, mom was taking Cole to school, we had I had to go with her. So I wouldn't be in the house alone. And then when I got back, I was in tears again, because I'll have a jumped up and he spilled all over the floor. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the I'll have a jumped up. And he spilled milk like I had a cup of milk right next to my piece of paper. So we got it dried. It was fine. It's just I couldn't really erase or anything. Let me see. Oh, that's incredible. Wow. So that was a mirror of how you felt? Yeah, I was just And so how did? How did it feel after you drew that? I felt kind of weird. Do you feel any better? Did you feel any worse? I felt a little worse. I don't know why. I thought that would help. So how do you feel about Christmas coming up? What's your emotions about Christmas? Really exciting. Okay. And what is the light blue? It's like a light blue. A light blue. Okay. So do you want to draw how you're going to feel about how your emotions about how you feel about Christmas coming? You could draw anything. You could draw some Christmas trees, a Christmas present and use well, Christmas tree would be green, but anything you want that has the colors that you with your emotions. Um, can I go get the paper and paint? Yes, of course. Because I didn't get anything ready. That's okay. Okay. Oh, you found it? Okay. Other thing that we can show and express our emotions is by certain kinds of lines that you're going to be coloring with. So we've got straight lines, jagged lines, zigzag lines, and also like the direction of the line that you're going to draw. So you could draw something like an emotion going up an emotion going down to show like how much like if you're going to if you're going to draw something about feeling happy, then you can draw like a line going up if that's how you feel happy or if you feel happy with the line coming down. Or if you feel sad, like which direction is it a zigzag line and and adding in the color. Does that make sense? That kind of does it. You know, it's hard because as you know, because you're such a good artist, like, there's not really many rules about drawing. You know what you're feeling or what you're thinking? Yeah, you just do it. You just don't think of doing it, you just do it. Yeah. So sorry, I have the hiccups. You're nervous a little bit? What are you nervous about? I'm trying to be good for happy. Oh, well, we don't have to do happy. Do you want to do another a sad one? I don't know. Or an angry one? We can do any way that you're feeling. Um, I have an idea. Okay. So I get water and then I get like a big brush. Huh? And then to get some water. And then I get like Christmas colors, maybe. Going to start out with the green. I love this idea. This is great. And then get more green, like to make it like all mushy and like make sure you really got it like soaked in paintbrush. And then here's the twist. Put it back in your cup. And then you just throw it around. And if you need more, then you can grab more. I love that. What a great idea. And then always need more glitter because I got glitter, a lot of color. And then we, um, we make sure all the watercolor paints out of it, then we put it back in all of our brushes. And then you dip your hand in there kind of, kind of like splash it on the paper, splash, splash, you know. I mean, like more color here. I love that. Oh my gosh, what a great idea. You're so artistic. Splash, splash, splash, yes. Splash. For some reason, the color's not showing up. Hmm. I thought it would. That's a lot of color. There. There, I got a lot of color. Oh, nice. And if you really want to do like a dark color, then get a color red. And what emotion does red mean to you again? Is that anger? Yeah, yes. What emotion do you feel like you feel the most throughout your day? Orange. So the anxiety? Yes. There, I got like, like a gray. That's what I wanted. And we splash it some more on our paper. I love that you're so artistic. And then we kind of let that dry. But like, make sure you get it like, like all over the place, like no missing spots on the paper. Well, we're gonna leave that to dry. Okay. Because the most important thing is letting it dry. Because if you don't let it dry, then basically, well, it's not gonna work. Okay, that makes sense. Let me get let me get a washcloth. Sorry, it kind of got all over the tablet. So I'm only let that dry. Like, if you want to make it fast, you can use a blow dryer, but I want to do that. Yeah, that's, I can't wait to see it once it dries. So what did you tell me about what you what you made? Like the colors? Or what? How does it relate to your feelings? Because there's a bunch of splashes in my mind of feelings. And, you know, like, I kind of wanted a red in my cup. But I got the gray because I got green first. Mm hmm. But it's like doing a line with a pencil. And you know, like when you erase, it doesn't erase all the way. Right? Right. So you just erase and you erase and you erase nonstop. What color so you got mostly gray or so you got the same color when you're erasing? Okay, yeah. But you wanted more of an orange to show more anger? Yeah. Okay. Do you feel like anything helps the anxiety or the anger that you feel during the days? No, not really. It's my slime. Okay, yeah. Kind of a special. What kind of slime did you get? Oh, put that on me, Alexa. My Alexa's like, don't put you there. Mine does that too. And, like, what were you gonna say? What kind of slime did you get? Do you get do you have? I have a lot of slimes. Lots of different kinds. Did you go to the slime store? They have a slime store that just sells just slime. Oh, that's cool. But no, I just went to Walmart. We got this like big bunk of junk basket full of slimes. Oh, very cool. I wish I could go there. It would be the love of my life. Slime is boogers. And I'm like, no, it's not. Yeah, I actually like to play with it, too. It's kind of fun. So, so you like so playing with slime is a little bit, a little bit helpful. So how often throughout the day do you feel like you're getting this angry and feeling and this anxiety feeling? I'm like, a lot. 100%. Okay. Sometimes 99, but only sometimes. So when you first wake up in the morning, do you feel it? Or does it take a little bit of time to start coming on? It takes a little bit of time to start coming on. Okay. Does anything make it worse? A lot. Like what specific? Cole. Your brother? Yeah. And what? And what does he do? What are the things that he does that's making it that makes it worse? Like mom and dad told me to suck it up. Like even dad, like I told them, I hate the words. I hate the sentence suck it up. But and I told them that the dad forgot because he said that yesterday. So I couldn't wait. So I just had dabbed it like with my washcloth. So and if you like, do you have this type of pen? I think it's called a pen. Yeah. Let me go get it. Okay. Okay. I got it. Okay, good. Sorry, I had to jump. It was in my Posca marker thing. Okay. So it's like a small Sharpie. And then around the spiders, if you still can't see them, can you kind of like outline them with a black pencil like this until you're all done with them. But if it's still too wet, just make sure you dab it a little more. Okay. You'd be an amazing art teacher too. Okay. It's not really working because I don't know why. Is it because it's wet too wet? No, I tried it like really good. It's just not doing its thing. Okay. So you were saying that your dad basically says, tells you to suck it up, but your brother gets away with more? Yes, he gets more attention. He gets everything that he wants. Hmm. So how does that make you feel when that happens? Like I'm a ghost, like nobody's, like everybody's ignoring me and it just feels sad. Yeah, I can understand that. That would really feel sad. Is there any times that you don't feel like a ghost? No. So it's always? Yeah. I can see how that would really hurt you, make you feel, feel upset. Do you feel like when you are angry or show more of your anger emotions, does that get you more attention or less attention? Less. That's why I don't want to tell anybody my emotions. So you feel it's better to try to hold them in? Yeah. Does that seem to caught when you're holding in your feelings? Does that give you more anxiety, more of the orange color? Yes. Okay. Okay. I wonder if there's a way that we can talk to people about how we're feeling and get a better result from them. So like, I wonder if we can figure out. They'll always say the same thing because I know my mom, my dad, everybody else at school, they always say the same thing. Even the teachers at school, they always say the same thing. What did they say? Sometimes I don't even remember because it's just stuck on my head too much that my memory wants it out of my head. Yeah. And it's hard to, we don't like to remember things that make us unhappy too. So that makes sense. I wonder if maybe this week you can try to pay attention to what people are saying when you try to talk about your feelings to them. And then do you ever, do you know how to journal? Do you write things down ever? Only sometimes I do. Do you like to do it or no? Only sometimes. Okay. I wonder if we can try to, if you can try to remember this week and pay attention to what people say that make you, make you not want to share your emotions. And then, and then we can talk about it next week. Do you think that at least you don't have to say anything to them? Just take note of what they say that makes you upset, that hurts your feelings, that makes you not want to share your feelings. That way we can pay attention. Does that sound good? Yeah. It's just sometimes I don't want to say it. I just remembered it right now, but it's the same word that my dad says a lot. And my mom says a lot and everybody else says a lot. Which one is it? The suck it up buttercup one. Okay. And everybody keeps just telling you to suck it up instead of. Yeah. I can totally understand how upsetting and why you would just not share your feelings. That makes sense. That probably makes you really upset. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if we can think of another different way to say it. So like when, when your brother is, when your mom or dad seems like they're giving him more attention, how do you tell them that? Like act like I'm your mom or your dad and your brother just did the same thing that you did, but you got in trouble and your brother didn't get in trouble. I would get so mad that I would probably scream a bad word, but I never did that. But I always want to. Right. Right. So you get so upset and you would scream at mom and dad, though you would scream and yell. Is that what you would do? Yeah. Okay. And I understand. I mean, I, I would too at times, especially if I felt like I was being mistreated. But I wonder if, have you tried to sit down and say like mom or dad, when, when brother is, does the same thing I do and he doesn't get in trouble, it hurts my feelings when I get in trouble for the same thing. Instead of screaming and yelling, I wonder if we could just try and see if how they react. And I never tried screaming and yelling. I only do that in my head. Oh, do you? So you hold it in? Yeah. That might be what's causing some of your anxiety is holding that in. We don't want to scream and yell because that might not, that's probably not going to get us the result that we want, but we want to be able to talk about our feelings in an appropriate way. So we want to try to learn that. Yeah. But I also want to make my voice clear. That's why I yell because people, when I talk in my normal voice, they, they act like I'm not there. Hmm. Like you even yelled once. Well, it wasn't a bad word, but I said, is anyone trying at least to listen to me? Like really loud. And nobody's, everybody's like, no, we're just ignoring you. That makes sense. I mean, I understand why you scream. I mean, that's, I would do the same thing if I felt like if nobody was listening for sure. If you felt invisible, I can understand that.  Sometimes when we scream, people shut down though, and they, they still don't hear us. So we have to think of a different way to get them to hear us. Yeah. But I tried every single way. Yeah. I can see that's frustrating for you for sure. What's your drawing you got so far? Good. Is it working? Yeah. So what are you going to be asking for Christmas for? Well, I kind of get shy when I try to say it. Do you want me to tell you what I'm asking for Christmas first? Sure. Okay. So I made my Christmas list to my kids and I said, I want a trip to Fiji. I want a trip to New Zealand. I want a trip. They're all trips, by the way. Oh. A trip to Bali and a trip to Africa. Why would you want to go to Africa? People kidnap you in Africa. Not all, not all parts. No, I, there are certain parts that are like safari. I would love to see like the elephants and I'd love to go on a safari. Okay, what do you want now? Can you see me? Yep. Can you see that? Yes, a beautiful kitty cat. What's her name or his name? Oliver and that's what I wrote for Christmas. You want another kitty cat? That's my pre-owned. I told mom and she's like, I would like 10 kitty cats. But dad said, maybe only if you'd be good. Like, and I said, it will sleep with me. I'll make it, I'll check its litter box. I'll cuddle with it. I always wanted my very own pet because I always sleep alone in my room with my stuffies. I'm kind of lonely. Well, I don't really want dogs because dogs snore. And mom says, I know dogs snore, but cats snore too. And like, I never heard all the bears snore then. And she's like, oh, whatever. So your dad says, if you're good, when he says, if you're good, what does he mean? What does he want you to do? Like a big huge, maybe. And like, be really good for him and happy. I wrote a letter to Santa and I used a lot of reallys. Lots of the word, really? You really, really, really, really, really, really want a cat like that? No, like five paragraphs of really. Oh, my gosh. I said, I really, really, really like four paragraphs later, really, really want a cat or a kitten, like whichever you want. I'll be good for happy and you. That was for Santa Claus and I drew him a picture. And then I also said, that's the whole thing I want in the whole entire world. And then I draw me on the picture, opening a box with little dots and then big dots. That means like so the kitty can breathe and stuff. Oh, well, did you did you try to tell your dad the reasons why you're not happy? Yeah, because have you heard of the therapy dog? I told him I want a therapy cat. Oh, so you think the cat's going to help you help take away the anger and the anxiety? Yeah. Sorry, it's just I. I was talking with mom one night and I left my tissue box in there. So I got the tissue box for out here and it's still in my room right now. So I just grabbed. Oh, thank you. Have allergies. Yeah, really bad. Yeah, me too, especially right now. I don't sneeze at all with the cat. No, no, it's not from the cat. Like no dog, no dog, no dog. So if I'm sure a cat would probably help a lot. But if you're angry because you feel like you're you're nobody notices you or hears you. We that I don't know if the cat's going to help people hear you. So we have to try to figure out a way that we can have. It helps me. Well, it helps me get attention. Yes. Because everybody says, who's that cat? And I'm like, my like, oh, you're so cool, because I'm already turning nine. And I'm going to keep the cat for the rest of my life. And like, when they come over, when I turn 10, they're going to be like, oh, that's so cute. Oh, I'm like, I really want to calico. That's a girl. But mom says calicos are all girls. And all girls are really sassy. Boys are more cuddly. And like, I didn't know that. Yeah. But this Oliver is really sassy. Oh, he's still a boy. He's still a boy. Right. So you want a girl cat? Yeah. But I was thinking to do it. I was thinking to do a boy cat, but it's fine. I need girls have more problems. Oh, do they? Yeah. It goes with dogs, too. Like, look. Oh, I love that. Tell me what it means. It means. It's like I'm. It means so I was going to get my pinkish. Yeah.  I was going to take orange. Okay. And then paint one of the dots orange. Okay. I want to stay in the line. So but mom got me this app on her tablet, which I'm talking to you on right now. I don't know what it's called, but it's like where I draw. And it's like so cool. Oh, that is really cool. And then I paint another one orange. And then a few more orange. Okay. So when you when you feel this anxiety, where in your body are you feeling it? I feel it in here. Yeah, I did here. Your chest and your belly. Okay. Like sometimes my belly, my stomach gets a little angry. Sometimes when I'm sad or mad. How long does it usually last the feeling? For a long, long time. Okay, does it? How does it go away? What makes it go away? When mom and dad like pay attention to me, they be nice to me. They do things for me. Okay. It's just all I want is respect and attention. That's pretty much all I want. Like when I tell Cole not to mess with me, he doesn't listen. Yeah, that sounds like it can be really frustrating. So it's like I kind of like to sometimes go out of the lines because it kind of looks cool. Mm hmm. And I'm about to be done with orange and then I'm gonna go to red next. Okay. When you are when you're in the red, when you're feeling angry, does the anger come on really quickly? Yes, I get I, I get anger issues really easy. Okay. Like, when people like when people walk in slow in front of me, I kind of just walk in front of them like really fast when I'm kind of in a rush. And oh, people walking into me, it's school. Oh, it's gone way too far already. And you on purpose or they bump where they bump? Yeah, they bump into me on purpose. They don't even say sorry. They just run away laughing. Oh, yeah, that would make me pretty upset too. So when you're with anyone pretty much at school, what did you say? I said, that's why I don't like to play with anyone at school pretty much because just sad, you know? Because I'm gonna leave some white because it's kind of when I like blinked out white means like, what was I doing? Or like, where was I going? You know? So now a little more red. Get that color in. That one, that one, and then blue. Blue now. And the blue is when you're sad? Yes. Okay. But did you know there's an Inside Out 2 in 2024? No, I didn't know that. I'm so excited because the new emotion is coming in. And it is anxiety. When new emotions come in, it's called puberty, I think. And I already passed that. When you should have puberty, like at 12 or 13 or something. Mm hmm. So you feel like you already passed that? Yeah, way past that. Like when I lost my first tooth. Like when I lost my first tooth, I was three years old, and my brother's five years old, and he barely lost any teeth yet. Oh, wow. You did. I'm already moving fast. Let's get this done over with quick snap. Right? Well, you are very mature. That's for sure. Yeah. That's probably why it seems like the kids in your school are quite immature. That would be that would be annoying for sure to be around people that were younger and bumped into you and did all that kind of stuff. So do you like People that were older than me that bumped into me like on purpose, I would get kind of scared because they're taller than me, they're bigger than me, especially boys bump into me like they're bigger than me, I get really scared and I don't say anything. I'm like really nervous. Oh, no. Like what if they'll punch me in the face? I mean, they never do. But right, right. It's just a what if, you know? So are you do you feel like you like being homeschooled better now? Yeah, but my mom's sending me to school next week. I'm like, why you? Okay. Like, why? How do you feel about that? Bad. Yeah. Are you what are you worried about? People are like gonna surround me because I don't really like it when I have too much attention. Because like people surround me ask me questions, they say weird stuff. They do a lot of things. A lot of weird things. Yeah. You can't believe what I'm doing right now. Can't wait to see it. Well, like with oil paints, to me, I'm not really a big fan. That's why I'm kind of not good. It's just oil paints. They dry really fast. So I don't blend that well. You know? Yeah, if the coloring, drawing watercolor, you know? Now I'm gonna do golden. I'm just gonna make it have a little red and make it like kind of orangey goldish, you know? Mm hmm. Like when I talk a lot, that means I'm like happy and fine. But that's like 2% of the time. So. Okay. How do you feel right now at this moment? Um, I'm really excited and happy this year. You're really excited and happy? Yeah, that happy this year. That happy? Oh, that the elfies there came to your house? Yeah. Oh, very nice. You call him happy? Yeah, his name is happy. When we first met him, we're like, whoa. On a note, his name is happy. Nice to meet you. One time, like last year, he said, I brought you snowmen from the North Pole, but it melted like with some carrots and like little rocks inside, you know, and in a little hat. How exciting. So I did some, um. Hold on. Where's the other? I did some Christmas trees and ornaments. Oh my gosh, I love that. Hold on, let me make my screen bigger so I can see better. Okay, now show me again. Let me see. Let me just get the excess off the watercolor brushes because they might drip and they don't ruin my painting because that happens to me a lot. Okay. Hold on. I forgot something. Oh my gosh, I love it. So I do see more of the orange for the anxiety, some blue, some red, there's a green even. What's the green mean? The green means just best, just like for the Christmas trees, and the white means like, what was I doing? I have a lot of whites. Oh, well, like my mom says, like, like when I was talking to another therapist, I think on Thursday. Um. Hold on. I was, um, kind of, I don't know what to say. It's like my mom said, maybe I had ADHD. And I'm like, what does that mean? And she's like, well, it's like, you flinch around and move, you don't sit down. And I'm like, yeah, I don't really, unless I have my tablet. And I don't, I like kind of move around, walk around, you know, nonstop. And then I'm like, still crazy at night. I'm like, oh, that's weird. But I think I like that. It's cute. Yeah, I love it. I love it. I think it looks like abstract, you know, because I kind of outside the lines and I, and I like it kind of because I always go with the lines. It does look very abstract. I love that. And I love that you even know that word. You're so smart. Well, how do I know this word? It's longer than Mississippi. What word? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Wow, that is a long word. It took me three years to say it. Like my dad says, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. You're cute. And congratulations on losing your tooth. And I'm glad Elphie is with you. And I will see you next week. You have anything else you want to talk about before we go? No, not really. All right. Your, your picture was amazing. Thank you so much for sharing that with me. Okay. All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye.

When mom was doing a photo shoot, Cole, like her class, she was going to a field, so she got some pink flags. And I was holding the flags, and Cole's complaining, why should I not, why should I, why did sissy get to hold the flags? And I'm like, Cole, just deal with it, and mom's like, just give him one, and like, fine. So, and then he was messing with it, and then he almost sticked me in the eye with it. That's why, that's why he got it taken away, and it got even worse. That's when he said it at lunch. And, and I was in tears in the car. And mom's like, what's wrong? And I told her, and she's like, well, you're not, you're letting him get to, you're letting him get to you. And I'm like, I'm serious, I'm not, in tears. I said, I'm serious, I'm not. And she always takes Cole's side. Oh, how does that make you feel when she takes Cole's side? Really, really bad. Like, really, really mad. Yeah, so mad, like more angry. And what, what color would you connect to being angry? Anxiety and red. Okay, so the orange for the anxiety, and then red for, for anger. Okay. And blue for sadness. I don't know what color that makes, but with all three colors combined, I don't know what that makes. Yeah. Okay. And what about for, do you ever have happy emotions? Not really. Not really. So your main emotions are anger, and having anxiety and sadness. Okay. How does that feel having just those, mostly just those three emotions? Like I work too hard that I just noticed that it's not even worth it anymore. To work hard, it's not worth working hard. Yeah, it's not really worth it. So, I mean, I don't want to get rid of those emotions, they want to have them, but not like all the time, not on a daily basis, you know. But it does happen every single day. Yeah, I can see that it's got to be frustrating. Can you draw me a picture of what these emotions would look like if you had them on paper, if you could draw it? How much of one would be there? How much each emotion would be there? And if there's any other emotions? Well, like, what's the ideas? Because you said I have some pretty good ideas, like to draw, like, for emotions. If you can show me, what are the ideas? Like what they already have? Let's see, there's a couple of them. Let me share my screen. Okay, let's see. Okay, so one of them, can you see this? Yeah. So somebody's got this one. And then somebody drew this for one of them. So there's no, there's no right or wrong. It's, it's truly just going to be like how you feel. You can draw anything. This one is like an extreme emotions. That's so anything you want. Like, a few days ago, I draw myself with a mirror. But and then when Cole was taking I mean, mom was taking Cole to school, we had I had to go with her. So I wouldn't be in the house alone. And then when I got back, I was in tears again, because I'll have a jumped up and he spilled all over the floor. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the house alone. And then I was like, I'm gonna be in the I'll have a jumped up. And he spilled milk like I had a cup of milk right next to my piece of paper. So we got it dried. It was fine. It's just I couldn't really erase or anything. Let me see. Oh, that's incredible. Wow. So that was a mirror of how you felt? Yeah, I was just And so how did? How did it feel after you drew that? I felt kind of weird. Do you feel any better? Did you feel any worse? I felt a little worse. I don't know why. I thought that would help. So how do you feel about Christmas coming up? What's your emotions about Christmas? Really exciting. Okay. And what is the light blue? It's like a light blue. A light blue. Okay. So do you want to draw how you're going to feel about how your emotions about how you feel about Christmas coming? You could draw anything. You could draw some Christmas trees, a Christmas present and use well, Christmas tree would be green, but anything you want that has the colors that you with your emotions. Um, can I go get the paper and paint? Yes, of course. Because I didn't get anything ready. That's okay. Okay. Oh, you found it? Okay. Other thing that we can show and express our emotions is by certain kinds of lines that you're going to be coloring with. So we've got straight lines, jagged lines, zigzag lines, and also like the direction of the line that you're going to draw. So you could draw something like an emotion going up an emotion going down to show like how much like if you're going to if you're going to draw something about feeling happy, then you can draw like a line going up if that's how you feel happy or if you feel happy with the line coming down. Or if you feel sad, like which direction is it a zigzag line and and adding in the color. Does that make sense? That kind of does it. You know, it's hard because as you know, because you're such a good artist, like, there's not really many rules about drawing. You know what you're feeling or what you're thinking? Yeah, you just do it. You just don't think of doing it, you just do it. Yeah. So sorry, I have the hiccups. You're nervous a little bit? What are you nervous about? I'm trying to be good for happy. Oh, well, we don't have to do happy. Do you want to do another a sad one? I don't know. Or an angry one? We can do any way that you're feeling. Um, I have an idea. Okay. So I get water and then I get like a big brush. Huh? And then to get some water. And then I get like Christmas colors, maybe. Going to start out with the green. I love this idea. This is great. And then get more green, like to make it like all mushy and like make sure you really got it like soaked in paintbrush. And then here's the twist. Put it back in your cup. And then you just throw it around. And if you need more, then you can grab more. I love that. What a great idea. And then always need more glitter because I got glitter, a lot of color. And then we, um, we make sure all the watercolor paints out of it, then we put it back in all of our brushes. And then you dip your hand in there kind of, kind of like splash it on the paper, splash, splash, you know. I mean, like more color here. I love that. Oh my gosh, what a great idea. You're so artistic. Splash, splash, splash, yes. Splash. For some reason, the color's not showing up. Hmm. I thought it would. That's a lot of color. There. There, I got a lot of color. Oh, nice. And if you really want to do like a dark color, then get a color red. And what emotion does red mean to you again? Is that anger? Yeah, yes. What emotion do you feel like you feel the most throughout your day? Orange. So the anxiety? Yes. There, I got like, like a gray. That's what I wanted. And we splash it some more on our paper. I love that you're so artistic. And then we kind of let that dry. But like, make sure you get it like, like all over the place, like no missing spots on the paper. Well, we're gonna leave that to dry. Okay. Because the most important thing is letting it dry. Because if you don't let it dry, then basically, well, it's not gonna work. Okay, that makes sense. Let me get let me get a washcloth. Sorry, it kind of got all over the tablet. So I'm only let that dry. Like, if you want to make it fast, you can use a blow dryer, but I want to do that. Yeah, that's, I can't wait to see it once it dries. So what did you tell me about what you what you made? Like the colors? Or what? How does it relate to your feelings? Because there's a bunch of splashes in my mind of feelings. And, you know, like, I kind of wanted a red in my cup. But I got the gray because I got green first. Mm hmm. But it's like doing a line with a pencil. And you know, like when you erase, it doesn't erase all the way. Right? Right. So you just erase and you erase and you erase nonstop. What color so you got mostly gray or so you got the same color when you're erasing? Okay, yeah. But you wanted more of an orange to show more anger? Yeah. Okay. Do you feel like anything helps the anxiety or the anger that you feel during the days? No, not really. It's my slime. Okay, yeah. Kind of a special. What kind of slime did you get? Oh, put that on me, Alexa. My Alexa's like, don't put you there. Mine does that too. And, like, what were you gonna say? What kind of slime did you get? Do you get do you have? I have a lot of slimes. Lots of different kinds. Did you go to the slime store? They have a slime store that just sells just slime. Oh, that's cool. But no, I just went to Walmart. We got this like big bunk of junk basket full of slimes. Oh, very cool. I wish I could go there. It would be the love of my life. Slime is boogers. And I'm like, no, it's not. Yeah, I actually like to play with it, too. It's kind of fun. So, so you like so playing with slime is a little bit, a little bit helpful. So how often throughout the day do you feel like you're getting this angry and feeling and this anxiety feeling? I'm like, a lot. 100%. Okay. Sometimes 99, but only sometimes. So when you first wake up in the morning, do you feel it? Or does it take a little bit of time to start coming on? It takes a little bit of time to start coming on. Okay. Does anything make it worse? A lot. Like what specific? Cole. Your brother? Yeah. And what? And what does he do? What are the things that he does that's making it that makes it worse? Like mom and dad told me to suck it up. Like even dad, like I told them, I hate the words. I hate the sentence suck it up. But and I told them that the dad forgot because he said that yesterday. So I couldn't wait. So I just had dabbed it like with my washcloth. So and if you like, do you have this type of pen? I think it's called a pen. Yeah. Let me go get it. Okay. Okay. I got it. Okay, good. Sorry, I had to jump. It was in my Posca marker thing. Okay. So it's like a small Sharpie. And then around the spiders, if you still can't see them, can you kind of like outline them with a black pencil like this until you're all done with them. But if it's still too wet, just make sure you dab it a little more. Okay. You'd be an amazing art teacher too. Okay. It's not really working because I don't know why. Is it because it's wet too wet? No, I tried it like really good. It's just not doing its thing. Okay. So you were saying that your dad basically says, tells you to suck it up, but your brother gets away with more? Yes, he gets more attention. He gets everything that he wants. Hmm. So how does that make you feel when that happens? Like I'm a ghost, like nobody's, like everybody's ignoring me and it just feels sad. Yeah, I can understand that. That would really feel sad. Is there any times that you don't feel like a ghost? No. So it's always? Yeah. I can see how that would really hurt you, make you feel, feel upset. Do you feel like when you are angry or show more of your anger emotions, does that get you more attention or less attention? Less. That's why I don't want to tell anybody my emotions. So you feel it's better to try to hold them in? Yeah. Does that seem to caught when you're holding in your feelings? Does that give you more anxiety, more of the orange color? Yes. Okay. Okay. I wonder if there's a way that we can talk to people about how we're feeling and get a better result from them. So like, I wonder if we can figure out. They'll always say the same thing because I know my mom, my dad, everybody else at school, they always say the same thing. Even the teachers at school, they always say the same thing. What did they say? Sometimes I don't even remember because it's just stuck on my head too much that my memory wants it out of my head. Yeah. And it's hard to, we don't like to remember things that make us unhappy too. So that makes sense. I wonder if maybe this week you can try to pay attention to what people are saying when you try to talk about your feelings to them. And then do you ever, do you know how to journal? Do you write things down ever? Only sometimes I do. Do you like to do it or no? Only sometimes. Okay. I wonder if we can try to, if you can try to remember this week and pay attention to what people say that make you, make you not want to share your emotions. And then, and then we can talk about it next week. Do you think that at least you don't have to say anything to them? Just take note of what they say that makes you upset, that hurts your feelings, that makes you not want to share your feelings. That way we can pay attention. Does that sound good? Yeah. It's just sometimes I don't want to say it. I just remembered it right now, but it's the same word that my dad says a lot. And my mom says a lot and everybody else says a lot. Which one is it? The suck it up buttercup one. Okay. And everybody keeps just telling you to suck it up instead of. Yeah. I can totally understand how upsetting and why you would just not share your feelings. That makes sense. That probably makes you really upset. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if we can think of another different way to say it. So like when, when your brother is, when your mom or dad seems like they're giving him more attention, how do you tell them that? Like act like I'm your mom or your dad and your brother just did the same thing that you did, but you got in trouble and your brother didn't get in trouble. I would get so mad that I would probably scream a bad word, but I never did that. But I always want to. Right. Right. So you get so upset and you would scream at mom and dad, though you would scream and yell. Is that what you would do? Yeah. Okay. And I understand. I mean, I, I would too at times, especially if I felt like I was being mistreated. But I wonder if, have you tried to sit down and say like mom or dad, when, when brother is, does the same thing I do and he doesn't get in trouble, it hurts my feelings when I get in trouble for the same thing. Instead of screaming and yelling, I wonder if we could just try and see if how they react. And I never tried screaming and yelling. I only do that in my head. Oh, do you? So you hold it in? Yeah. That might be what's causing some of your anxiety is holding that in. We don't want to scream and yell because that might not, that's probably not going to get us the result that we want, but we want to be able to talk about our feelings in an appropriate way. So we want to try to learn that. Yeah. But I also want to make my voice clear. That's why I yell because people, when I talk in my normal voice, they, they act like I'm not there. Hmm. Like you even yelled once. Well, it wasn't a bad word, but I said, is anyone trying at least to listen to me? Like really loud. And nobody's, everybody's like, no, we're just ignoring you. That makes sense. I mean, I understand why you scream. I mean, that's, I would do the same thing if I felt like if nobody was listening for sure. If you felt invisible, I can understand that.  Sometimes when we scream, people shut down though, and they, they still don't hear us. So we have to think of a different way to get them to hear us. Yeah. But I tried every single way. Yeah. I can see that's frustrating for you for sure. What's your drawing you got so far? Good. Is it working? Yeah. So what are you going to be asking for Christmas for? Well, I kind of get shy when I try to say it. Do you want me to tell you what I'm asking for Christmas first? Sure. Okay. So I made my Christmas list to my kids and I said, I want a trip to Fiji. I want a trip to New Zealand. I want a trip. They're all trips, by the way. Oh. A trip to Bali and a trip to Africa. Why would you want to go to Africa? People kidnap you in Africa. Not all, not all parts. No, I, there are certain parts that are like safari. I would love to see like the elephants and I'd love to go on a safari. Okay, what do you want now? Can you see me? Yep. Can you see that? Yes, a beautiful kitty cat. What's her name or his name? Oliver and that's what I wrote for Christmas. You want another kitty cat? That's my pre-owned. I told mom and she's like, I would like 10 kitty cats. But dad said, maybe only if you'd be good. Like, and I said, it will sleep with me. I'll make it, I'll check its litter box. I'll cuddle with it. I always wanted my very own pet because I always sleep alone in my room with my stuffies. I'm kind of lonely. Well, I don't really want dogs because dogs snore. And mom says, I know dogs snore, but cats snore too. And like, I never heard all the bears snore then. And she's like, oh, whatever. So your dad says, if you're good, when he says, if you're good, what does he mean? What does he want you to do? Like a big huge, maybe. And like, be really good for him and happy. I wrote a letter to Santa and I used a lot of reallys. Lots of the word, really? You really, really, really, really, really, really want a cat like that? No, like five paragraphs of really. Oh, my gosh. I said, I really, really, really like four paragraphs later, really, really want a cat or a kitten, like whichever you want. I'll be good for happy and you. That was for Santa Claus and I drew him a picture. And then I also said, that's the whole thing I want in the whole entire world. And then I draw me on the picture, opening a box with little dots and then big dots. That means like so the kitty can breathe and stuff. Oh, well, did you did you try to tell your dad the reasons why you're not happy? Yeah, because have you heard of the therapy dog? I told him I want a therapy cat. Oh, so you think the cat's going to help you help take away the anger and the anxiety? Yeah. Sorry, it's just I. I was talking with mom one night and I left my tissue box in there. So I got the tissue box for out here and it's still in my room right now. So I just grabbed. Oh, thank you. Have allergies. Yeah, really bad. Yeah, me too, especially right now. I don't sneeze at all with the cat. No, no, it's not from the cat. Like no dog, no dog, no dog. So if I'm sure a cat would probably help a lot. But if you're angry because you feel like you're you're nobody notices you or hears you. We that I don't know if the cat's going to help people hear you. So we have to try to figure out a way that we can have. It helps me. Well, it helps me get attention. Yes. Because everybody says, who's that cat? And I'm like, my like, oh, you're so cool, because I'm already turning nine. And I'm going to keep the cat for the rest of my life. And like, when they come over, when I turn 10, they're going to be like, oh, that's so cute. Oh, I'm like, I really want to calico. That's a girl. But mom says calicos are all girls. And all girls are really sassy. Boys are more cuddly. And like, I didn't know that. Yeah. But this Oliver is really sassy. Oh, he's still a boy. He's still a boy. Right. So you want a girl cat? Yeah. But I was thinking to do it. I was thinking to do a boy cat, but it's fine. I need girls have more problems. Oh, do they? Yeah. It goes with dogs, too. Like, look. Oh, I love that. Tell me what it means. It means. It's like I'm. It means so I was going to get my pinkish. Yeah.  I was going to take orange. Okay. And then paint one of the dots orange. Okay. I want to stay in the line. So but mom got me this app on her tablet, which I'm talking to you on right now. I don't know what it's called, but it's like where I draw. And it's like so cool. Oh, that is really cool. And then I paint another one orange. And then a few more orange. Okay. So when you when you feel this anxiety, where in your body are you feeling it? I feel it in here. Yeah, I did here. Your chest and your belly. Okay. Like sometimes my belly, my stomach gets a little angry. Sometimes when I'm sad or mad. How long does it usually last the feeling? For a long, long time. Okay, does it? How does it go away? What makes it go away? When mom and dad like pay attention to me, they be nice to me. They do things for me. Okay. It's just all I want is respect and attention. That's pretty much all I want. Like when I tell Cole not to mess with me, he doesn't listen. Yeah, that sounds like it can be really frustrating. So it's like I kind of like to sometimes go out of the lines because it kind of looks cool. Mm hmm. And I'm about to be done with orange and then I'm gonna go to red next. Okay. When you are when you're in the red, when you're feeling angry, does the anger come on really quickly? Yes, I get I, I get anger issues really easy. Okay. Like, when people like when people walk in slow in front of me, I kind of just walk in front of them like really fast when I'm kind of in a rush. And oh, people walking into me, it's school. Oh, it's gone way too far already. And you on purpose or they bump where they bump? Yeah, they bump into me on purpose. They don't even say sorry. They just run away laughing. Oh, yeah, that would make me pretty upset too. So when you're with anyone pretty much at school, what did you say? I said, that's why I don't like to play with anyone at school pretty much because just sad, you know? Because I'm gonna leave some white because it's kind of when I like blinked out white means like, what was I doing? Or like, where was I going? You know? So now a little more red. Get that color in. That one, that one, and then blue. Blue now. And the blue is when you're sad? Yes. Okay. But did you know there's an Inside Out 2 in 2024? No, I didn't know that. I'm so excited because the new emotion is coming in. And it is anxiety. When new emotions come in, it's called puberty, I think. And I already passed that. When you should have puberty, like at 12 or 13 or something. Mm hmm. So you feel like you already passed that? Yeah, way past that. Like when I lost my first tooth. Like when I lost my first tooth, I was three years old, and my brother's five years old, and he barely lost any teeth yet. Oh, wow. You did. I'm already moving fast. Let's get this done over with quick snap. Right? Well, you are very mature. That's for sure. Yeah. That's probably why it seems like the kids in your school are quite immature. That would be that would be annoying for sure to be around people that were younger and bumped into you and did all that kind of stuff. So do you like People that were older than me that bumped into me like on purpose, I would get kind of scared because they're taller than me, they're bigger than me, especially boys bump into me like they're bigger than me, I get really scared and I don't say anything. I'm like really nervous. Oh, no. Like what if they'll punch me in the face? I mean, they never do. But right, right. It's just a what if, you know? So are you do you feel like you like being homeschooled better now? Yeah, but my mom's sending me to school next week. I'm like, why you? Okay. Like, why? How do you feel about that? Bad. Yeah. Are you what are you worried about? People are like gonna surround me because I don't really like it when I have too much attention. Because like people surround me ask me questions, they say weird stuff. They do a lot of things. A lot of weird things. Yeah. You can't believe what I'm doing right now. Can't wait to see it. Well, like with oil paints, to me, I'm not really a big fan. That's why I'm kind of not good. It's just oil paints. They dry really fast. So I don't blend that well. You know? Yeah, if the coloring, drawing watercolor, you know? Now I'm gonna do golden. I'm just gonna make it have a little red and make it like kind of orangey goldish, you know? Mm hmm. Like when I talk a lot, that means I'm like happy and fine. But that's like 2% of the time. So. Okay. How do you feel right now at this moment? Um, I'm really excited and happy this year. You're really excited and happy? Yeah, that happy this year. That happy? Oh, that the elfies there came to your house? Yeah. Oh, very nice. You call him happy? Yeah, his name is happy. When we first met him, we're like, whoa. On a note, his name is happy. Nice to meet you. One time, like last year, he said, I brought you snowmen from the North Pole, but it melted like with some carrots and like little rocks inside, you know, and in a little hat. How exciting. So I did some, um. Hold on. Where's the other? I did some Christmas trees and ornaments. Oh my gosh, I love that. Hold on, let me make my screen bigger so I can see better. Okay, now show me again. Let me see. Let me just get the excess off the watercolor brushes because they might drip and they don't ruin my painting because that happens to me a lot. Okay. Hold on. I forgot something. Oh my gosh, I love it. So I do see more of the orange for the anxiety, some blue, some red, there's a green even. What's the green mean? The green means just best, just like for the Christmas trees, and the white means like, what was I doing? I have a lot of whites. Oh, well, like my mom says, like, like when I was talking to another therapist, I think on Thursday. Um. Hold on. I was, um, kind of, I don't know what to say. It's like my mom said, maybe I had ADHD. And I'm like, what does that mean? And she's like, well, it's like, you flinch around and move, you don't sit down. And I'm like, yeah, I don't really, unless I have my tablet. And I don't, I like kind of move around, walk around, you know, nonstop. And then I'm like, still crazy at night. I'm like, oh, that's weird. But I think I like that. It's cute. Yeah, I love it. I love it. I think it looks like abstract, you know, because I kind of outside the lines and I, and I like it kind of because I always go with the lines. It does look very abstract. I love that. And I love that you even know that word. You're so smart. Well, how do I know this word? It's longer than Mississippi. What word? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Wow, that is a long word. It took me three years to say it. Like my dad says, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. You're cute. And congratulations on losing your tooth. And I'm glad Elphie is with you. And I will see you next week. You have anything else you want to talk about before we go? No, not really. All right. Your, your picture was amazing. Thank you so much for sharing that with me. Okay. All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye.

    "  prompt=\"\"\"Once upon a time, in a realm where myths and legends were woven into the very fabric of existence, there lived a magnificent dragon named Draegonar. This extraordinary creature was not like the typical dragons one might imagine. Draegonar was not a menace to the kingdom, nor was he a symbol of terror. Instead, he was a guardian, a keeper of ancient wisdom, and a symbol of hope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Draegonar resided in the heart of the Whispering Woods, a mystical forest where the leaves whispered secrets to those who dared to listen. His lair was hidden deep within a cavern adorned with shimmering crystals that illuminated the chamber with a soft, ethereal glow. The dragon's scales shimmered in hues of emerald green and sapphire blue, and his eyes sparkled like the stars in the night sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "For centuries, Draegonar had watched over the land, ensuring the balance between magic and reality. His duty was to protect the ancient knowledge that had been passed down through generations, knowledge that held the key to preserving the harmony of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "One fateful day, a brave young adventurer named Elara stumbled upon the Whispering Woods. She had heard tales of the enigmatic dragon who resided there and had set out on a quest to seek his wisdom. As she ventured deeper into the forest, the leaves began to murmur stories of her arrival, and the very trees seemed to bow in respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elara finally reached the entrance to Draegonar's lair, where she was met by the guardian of the woods, a wise old owl named Aelius. Aelius sensed the purity of Elara's heart and told her of the dragon's importance in maintaining the balance of their world.\n",
    "\n",
    "With trepidation and reverence, Elara entered the cavern and laid eyes upon Draegonar, whose size and majesty took her breath away. She approached him with a humble bow and introduced herself, explaining her purpose for seeking his wisdom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Draegonar, in his deep, rumbling voice, acknowledged her presence and agreed to share his knowledge. He began to tell her of the ancient ways of magic and the importance of harmony in their world. He spoke of the delicate balance that must be maintained between the elements and the creatures that inhabited their realm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As days turned into weeks, Elara learned from Draegonar the secrets of the land, the language of the stars, and the songs of the wind. She grew wiser with each passing moment, and her bond with the dragon deepened. Draegonar saw in her the potential to carry on his legacy and ensure the continued prosperity of their world.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the tranquility of their existence was soon disrupted by a looming threat. A dark sorcerer named Malachar, hungry for power, sought to capture Draegonar and harness his magic for his nefarious purposes. Malachar's army of shadowy creatures descended upon the Whispering Woods, shrouding the once-gentle forest in darkness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elara and Draegonar knew that they must stand together to protect their realm. With the dragon's guidance, Elara honed her newfound skills in magic and became a formidable guardian in her own right. The forest creatures rallied to their cause, and a great battle ensued.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the sun set on the final clash between light and darkness, Elara and Draegonar stood victorious. Malachar's dark influence was banished, and the Whispering Woods returned to its peaceful state. The dragon and the young adventurer had proven that even the most unlikely of alliances could overcome the greatest of challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, Draegonar entrusted Elara with the continued protection of their realm and the wisdom he had shared. She became known as the Dragon's Guardian, and her tale, along with that of the benevolent dragon, became a cherished legend throughout the land.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, in a world where dragons were often feared and misunderstood, Draegonar became a symbol of hope and enlightenment, a testament to the enduring power of unity and the magic that resides within every heart that seeks to protect and preserve the beauty of their world.\"\"\",\n",
